Photopea Showcase</h1>
<p><b><a href="index.html">Home</a></b></p>

<p>Welcome to my Photopea Page. This is your one-stop shop to see some select NASCAR Racing 2003 Season Paint Schemes that I've created in 2023 and 2024.</p>

<h3>2023</h3>

<h2>Tyler Reddick: Spider-Gwen x 23XI Racing Concept Scheme</h2>
<p><img src="photopea/RendReddickSV23.png" width="750" height="400" alt="ghost spider reddick"></p>
<p>Created right around the time of Across The Spider-Verse's initial release, this ride is part of a 3-car set featuring paint schemes based on Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy, & Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Suit designs. This proved to be the favorite among the friends I've shown the design to.</p>

<h2>Bubba Wallace: Spider-Man x 23XI Racing Concept Scheme</h2>
<p><img src="photopea/RendWallaceSV23.png" width="750" height="400" alt="spider man wallace"></p>
<p>Clean, Red and Simple. Those are the 3 words I'd describe the Miles Morales paint scheme for Bubba Wallace. As Bubba is Tyler Reddick's current teammate in the NASCAR Cup Series, bringing his #23 Toyota into the fun felt right, and is a bit of a tribute to the duel sponsored schemes that teams would run in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>

<h2>Daniel Suarez: Spider-Man 2099 x Trackhouse Racing Concept Scheme</h2>
<p><img src="photopea/RendSuarezSV23.png" width="750" height="400" alt="2099 suarez"></p>
<p>The last scheme created during this Spider-Man themed stretch. This one focused on Miguel's Mexican roots and since Suarez has run Mexican Heritige paint schemes with Coca-Cola on the hood, I felt it was right to give Daniel Suarez some of that 2099 flair.</p>


<h3>2024</h3>

<h2>Wally Dallenbach Jr: The Powerpuff Girls 2000 Ford Taurus (Next-Gen Version)</h2>

<p><img src="photopea/RendDallenbachPPG00.png" width="750" height="400" alt="the 4th powerpuff girl"></p>

   <p>One of the first paint schemes that I worked on earlier this year, and the first to include work from Adobe Illustrator. This was a fun project and really tested my Adobe Illustrator skills and was a easy time implementing those vectors onto the Ford Mustang template.</p>

<h2>Daniel Hemric: Space Ghost Coast to Coast 30th Anniversary Concept Scheme</h2>

<p><img src="photopea/RendHemricSG24.png" width="750" height="400" alt="hemric and the space ghost"></p>
<p>Another 2024 Project that features some usage of the vectors featured in the <a href="illustrator.html">Illustrator</a> page. This was created thanks to the show turning 30 years old and was part of a set of Adult Swim paint schemes until I scrapped that idea. This is the only completed remnant of that idea.</p>

<h2>Erik Jones: STP/CheckIt4Andretti Throwback Concept</h2>

<p><img src="photopea/RendJonesTB24.png" width="750" height="400" alt="a tribute to andretti"></p>
<p>One of many paint schemes I've created as a conceptual design for NASCAR's Throwback Weekend, this one is based on John Andretti's STP Pontiac that he ran for Petty Enterprises in the year 2000. This also serves as a tribute to the man, as he passed away in 2018 due to Colon Cancer, and the #CheckItForAndretti began in honor of his memory.</p>
